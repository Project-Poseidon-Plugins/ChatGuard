## Features
**ChatGuard** is a Minecraft plugin designed for servers running version b1.7.3.

- Cancels messages containing blocked terms or matching RegEx patterns.
- Prevents players from joining with usernames containing blocked terms or matching RegEx patterns.
- Logs offenders (via Discord webhook, server console, or local file).
- Prevents chat message and command spam.
- Prompts captcha verification on suspected bot-like behavior.
- Issues temporary mutes (requires [Essentials v2.5.8](#requirements) as of ChatGuard `v4.1.0`).
- Enforces escalating penalties via a six-strike tier system.
- Plays local sound cues for offending players upon detection.

The plugin is entirely configurable.

```

### Strikes
The default `strikes.yml` configuration file is initially empty. When a player joins for the first time after ChatGuard is installed on the server, they are added to the configuration with 0 strikes. From there, the plugin manages their strikes, incrementing them up to a maximum of 5 as necessary. Read note below on how that works.

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸ”–`v4.1.0`: Strike tiers will increment only when the filter is enabled, and a disallowed term or matching regex pattern is detected in a message. Otherwise, all strike tiers will default to 0 unless manually modified in the configuration file or through the included command.
