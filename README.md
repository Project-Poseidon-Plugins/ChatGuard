> [!WARNING]
> Install a compatible plugin to use the auto mute feature.
> - Compatible plugins are [Essentials v2.5.8](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/ChatGuard/raw/refs/heads/master/libs/Essentials.jar) and [ZCore](https://github.com/zavdav/ZCore) (as of ChatGuard `v6.0.0`).
>
> If `auto-mute.enabled` in `config/config.yml` is left on `true`, it will act as disabled when no compatible plugins are detected.

> [!NOTE]  
> Strike tiers increment only when the filter is enabled and a disallowed term or matching regex pattern is detected.
>
> Otherwise, all strike tiers default to `0` unless manually modified in `data/strikes.yml` or via the staff command.
