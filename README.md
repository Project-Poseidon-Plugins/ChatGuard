> [!WARNING]  
> **Important for auto mute feature**<br/>
> If your server is not running a compatible plugin, you must do one of the following:
> - **Disable auto mute support** by setting `filter.auto-mute.enabled` to `false` in `config/config.yml`.
> - **Install Compatible plugin** to use the auto mute feature.
>   - Compatible plugins are [Essentials v2.5.8](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/ChatGuard/raw/refs/heads/master/libs/Essentials.jar) and [ZCore](https://github.com/zavdav/ZCore) (as of ChatGuard `v6.0.0`, **not yet released**).
>
> Without one of the two, ChatGuard could break, and in-game messages might fail to send.

> [!NOTE]  
> Strike tiers increment only when the filter is enabled and a disallowed term or matching regex pattern is detected.
>
> Otherwise, all strike tiers default to `0` unless manually modified in `data/strikes.yml` or via the staff command.
