# Contributing
ChatGuard has a devlog which you can visit [here](https://github.com/users/AleksandarHaralanov/projects/1).

## Workflow Guidelines
- **External contributors** should fork the repository and open pull requests to `master` with their changes.
- **Write-access users** can commit directly to `master`, but they should follow the PR-based workflow if they are unsure about their changes.

Once reviewed and approved, changes will be **squash merged** into `master` to maintain a clean history.

> [!WARNING]
> **Pull requests that do not follow these instructions will be rejected.**<br/>
> You will receive a comment explaining what was incorrect, so you can make the necessary changes and resubmit.

> [!TIP]
> **Optional credits to contributors.**<br/>
> You can add your name [here](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/ChatGuard/blob/9a735f1fc0bdb94325f27b3798c31214bd7f77fc/src/main/java/io/github/aleksandarharalanov/chatguard/command/subcommand/AboutCommand.java#L22) to be credited in the plugin's about command for your contribution.

## Coding Conventions
This is an open-source project. Keep in mind the people who will read and work with your codeâ€”make it clean and easy to understand.

When reading the code, you'll quickly get the hang of it. Focus on optimizing for readability:

- Do not leave zombie code behind.
- Clean and concise comments are encouraged if they improve understanding.
- Use an indentation of **four spaces** whenever possible; **two spaces are also acceptable** if preferred.
- Follow object-oriented principles such as SOLID to improve code maintainability.
- Prefer Java Streams and functional programming when applicable, as they improve code readability and performance.
- Use proper Java keywords and modifiers to ensure encapsulation and best practices:
- Always include spaces:
  - After list items and method parameters (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`).
  - Around operators (e.g., `x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  - Around hash arrows, curly braces, etc.
- If possible, please avoid algorithms with bad space and time complexity.
  - Learn more about Big O notation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).

Following these conventions will help maintain high-quality code and make contributions easier for everyone.
