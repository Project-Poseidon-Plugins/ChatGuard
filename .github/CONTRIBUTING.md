# Contributing
ChatGuard has a devlog which you can visit [here](https://github.com/users/AleksandarHaralanov/projects/1).

## Contribution Workflow
All contributions must be made to the `staging` branch via pull requests (PRs).

- **Write-access users** must create a **feature branch** from `staging`, push changes to it, and open a pull request to `staging`.
- **External contributors** must fork the repository, make changes in the `staging` branch of their fork, and open a pull request to `staging`.

Once reviewed and approved, changes from `staging` will be **squash merged** into `master` to maintain a clean history.

> ![NOTE]
> **Pull requests that do not follow these instructions will be rejected.**<br/>
> You will receive a comment explaining what was incorrect, so you can make the necessary changes and resubmit.

### Optional Contributor Recognition
You can add your name [here]() to be credited in the plugin's about command for your contribution.

## Coding Conventions
This is an open-source project. Keep in mind the people who will read and work with your codeâ€”make it clean and easy to understand.

When reading the code, you'll quickly get the hang of it. Focus on optimizing for readability:

- Do not leave zombie code behind.
- Clean and concise comments are encouraged if they improve understanding.
- Use an indentation of **four spaces** whenever possible; **two spaces are also acceptable** if preferred.
- Follow object-oriented principles such as SOLID to improve code maintainability.
- Prefer Java Streams and functional programming when applicable, as they improve code readability and performance.
- Use proper Java keywords and modifiers to ensure encapsulation and best practices:
- Always include spaces:
  - After list items and method parameters (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`).
  - Around operators (e.g., `x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  - Around hash arrows, curly braces, etc.
- If possible, please avoid algorithms with bad space and time complexity.
  - Learn more about Big O notation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).

Following these conventions will help maintain high-quality code and make contributions easier for everyone.
